SCRIPTS:
    matrix_model.py - Builds and performs contention metric prediction evaluation
                        Saves predicted QoS metrics in file named by the first parameter
    evaluate_qos.py - Reads the eval.data.csv file that should be produced 
                        by *_model.py based on metric_data

FILES:
    single_app_bubbles - File containing processed_data from single_app_contention
                    Product of the single_app_contention set of experiments
    experiment_data - File containing contention data for multiple applications
                        with reporter to determine observed bubble size
                    Product of the multi_app_contention set of experiments
    metric_data - File containing QoS metrics from QoS applications co-located
                    with batch applications
                    Product of the multi_app_with_qos set of experiments
    eval.data.csv - File containing QoS model predictions of the entire metric_data set
                    Designed to be processed by evaluate_qos.py
