# Benchmark Descriptions
In progress

## Stream
Stream is a memory intensive benchmark for stressing memory bandwidth and cache
[Stream Homepage](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/)

## Dhrystone
Dhrystone is a synthetic microbenchmark that stresses integer and branch operations.
It is intended to simulate a typical "systems programming" workload.


## Whetstone
Whetstone is a synthetic microbenchmark written in C that stresses a machines floating point performance.

## Livermore Loops
Livermore loops are a set of common core computational kernels.

## Linpack
Miniature version of the popular benchmark application.
Performs various matrix and linear algebra routines on small (~100x100 matrices)
Stresses the L1 and L2 caches, and the double precision floating point units
